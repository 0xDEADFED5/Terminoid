### Todo

- Chapters
- Better mobile experience
- Pipeline Redis queries

### Linux Installation
- Install Openresty from apt or whatever
- Requires Redis >= 6.2.0.  Right now apt/snap may be installing 6.0.x, so build it from source
- It took me around 5 minutes to build it from source and configure it on ARM64, it's really easy
- [install from source instructions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/install-redis-from-source/)
- [config instructions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/#install-redis-properly)
- Put the nginx.conf from this repo root where it goes, something like `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf`
- Copy the directory structure from repo root wherever your html goes, something like `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/html`
- Do your firewall and HTTPS stuff as needed
